I tinkered with this quite a bit to get the results.  I had not used the 'map' method before and I struggled a bit with getting the syntax correct.  Rubocop pointed out pretty obvious mistakes for correction (I created a variable that I did not end up using) and line lenght of my comments.

I had to work on this some more.  I had sovled most of the problem however I did not get a new array created.  Now I think I have satisfied that as well.
